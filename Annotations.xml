            <p><hi rend="italics">Louis Crompton: The Selected Homofiles</hi> presents a series of
               Louis Crompton's papers, which frame the events that occured at the University of
               Nebraska-Lincoln in 1970 surrounding his organization of the course "Proseminar in
               Homophile Studies," one of the earliest courses on queer sexuality taught in the
               United States. Furthermore, the political fallout which occurred after Crompton
               developed the course bears striking similarities to 21st century politicians'
               attempts to control academic curricula. </p>

         <note type="person" xml:id="terryCarpenter"><label>Carpenter, Terry McGovern
               (1900&#8211;1978) ("Terrible Terry"). State senator, Nebraska Legislature,
               1953&#8211;1955, 1957&#8211;1961, 1963&#8211;1974.</label>
            <p> Born in Cedar Rapids, IA, Carpenter moved to Scottsbluff, NE, in 1916 where he
               worked for various railroad and coal businesses. In 1932, voters of Nebraska's 5th
               Congressional District elected him as a Democrat to the US House of Representatives.
               He served only one term, frequently praising Adolf Hitler on the Congressional
               Record. After unsuccessful campaigns for both the US Senate and the Governor of
               Nebraska, Carpenter started various business interests in Scottsbluff, including a
               gasoline refinery. In 1952, he successfully won election to the Nebraska Legislature
               and served intermittently until 1974 as both a Democrat and a Republican, though the
               Nebraska Legislature is officially nonpartisan. In 1978, after Carpenter died, the
               Nebraska Legislature passed Legislative Bill 955, which renamed the Nebraska
               Educational Telecommunications Building the Terry M. Carpenter Educational
               Telecommunications Building. </p></note>

               influenced the architectural design of the Nebraska Educational Telecommunications
               Building, funding for which state Senator Terry Carpenter secured through Legislative
               Bill 65 in 1969. In 1971, during the building's construction on the east campus of
               the University of Nebraska&#8211;Lincoln, Carpenter threatened to repurpose the

               subsequently opened in 1972, and in 1978, the Nebraska Legislature passed Legislative
               Bill 955, which renamed it the Terry M. Carpenter Educational Telecommunications
               Building. In 2011, the Nebraska Legislature passed Legislative Bill 122, which once
               again renamed it the Terry M. Carpenter and Jack G. McBride Educational

            <p>Founded in 1966, the Phoenix Society for Individual Freedom was the first homophile
               organization in Kansas City, MO. Activists sought to improve the legal, social, and
               economic status of homosexuals in the community. Drew Shafer spearheaded the movement
               and eventually acted as the society’s first president. His mother Phyllis served as
               the secretary of the Phoenix Society, and his father Robert, a printer by trade,
               enabled Shafer to publish and distribute the Phoenix Society newsletter. </p>

               on Expenditures in the Executive Departments printed "Employment of Homosexuals And
               Other Sex Perverts in Government," which concluded that "those who engage in acts of

               Federal Government." The Senate authorized the investigation with the passage of
               Senate Resolution 280 (June 7, 1950), which was influenced by earlier investigations
               conducted by U.S. Senator Kenneth S. Wherry of Nebraska. </p>

               identified people with criminal records of "sexual perversion" as threats to national
               security and barred or terminated them from federal employment. In the 1950s, between
               7,000 and 10,000 workers lost jobs due to suspicions of homosexuality. President
               Barack Obama revoked the entirety of the Eisenhower order through his Executive Order

               Henry F. Pedersen and sponsored by Senator Terry Carpenter. The bill stated that “no

               psychiatric evaluation by the staff of Lincoln State Hospital and such evaluation

            <p>The Stonewall Riots, often referred to as the "Stonewall Uprising" or simply
               "Stonewall" took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, when New York
               City police officers raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village. At the
               time, New York State law prohibited public displays of homosexual behavior including
               holding hands, kissing, or dancing with someone of the same sex. The raid sparked
               outrage and led to six days of protests between officers and bar patrons. Stonewall
               is often credited as being the catalyst for the gay rights movement in the United
