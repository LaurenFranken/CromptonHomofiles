  <p class="introduction">STATEMENT TO LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON PROSEMINAR IN HOMOPHILE STUDIES</p>
  <p class="introduction">October 29, 1970</p>
  <p>Senator, I am very glad to have the opportunity to speak publicly about the new interdisciplinary course on homosexuality at the University of Nebraska. 
    Homosexuality is still a subject that sometimes arouses strong emotions in our society. But perhaps this may be in itself a real argument for studying it. 
    It is the emotional questions that most need to be talked about. And, of course, besides understandable public anxieties, there is also the problem of personal 
    anguish. If you bear with me for a moment I would like to put on the record a letter a girl wrote to Ann Landers a while ago--</p>
  <blockquote class="no-indent">Dear Ann Landers: I am a Lesbian. The word makes me sick, but there is nothing I can do about it. All I know is that I am 18 years old, and 
    I wish I were dead. I keep asking myself how I got this way and why it had to happen to me. Whenever I see a boy and girl holding hands, laughing and talking on a street corner, 
    I feel like throwing myself under the wheels of a truck.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>Don't suggest a psychiatrist. I couldn't afford one on my own, and I'd rather dies than tell my parents what is wrong with me. I don't know why I am writing to you, 
    because you can't help me. I guess I had to talk to somebody and you are the only one there is.</blockquote>
  <p class="uninterrupted">Of course professional people, and others too, come upon these cases from time to time. Unfortunately, they are often totally at sea as to what to do. 
    During an extensive survey I made of Lincoln's ministers and social workers they constantly emphasized that nothing in their training in colleges or seminaries had prepared 
    them at all for this kind of problem.</p>
  <p>It seemed to me that something needed to be done in the way of a course for prospective counsellors, social workers, doctors, ministers and even</p>

<p class="uniterrupted>police officers, and that this required a broad interdisciplinary knowledge of the subject. This meant not only a medical and legal approach but also one which showed how our 
          culture looked at the homosexual in such fields as creative literature. I was glad to see this sense of need for a broad approach confirmed in an important government document, the Report of the Task Force on Homosexuality 
          of the National Institute of Mental Health, issued exactly a year ago, which argued for interdisciplinary courses, and mentioned particularly the need to study the effects on the public of "the portrayal of homosexual behavior, 
   attitudes, and values in literature and drama."</p>

                       <p>Indeed, homosexuals in the United States are a very significant minority, perhaps the largets minority group after the Negro. What is more, young 
                       homosexuals, and by this I mean chiefly those of college age, are beginning to take a hard look at the facts of their existence. When they do this, what 
                       they see in store for them in future years is too often not the "understanding and justice for homosexuals" the Lutheran Church of America called for this summer 
                                                                                                                                  at its national convention, but ostracism, ridicule and rejection.</p>
