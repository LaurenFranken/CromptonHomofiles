   <p class="introduction">STATEMENT TO <a href="Annotations.html#legSub">LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE</a> ON PROSEMINAR IN HOMOPHILE STUDIES</p>
  <p class="introduction">October 29, 1970</p>
  <p>Senator, I am very glad to have the opportunity to speak publicly about the new interdisciplinary course on homosexuality at the University of Nebraska. 
    Homosexuality is still a subject that sometimes arouses strong emotions in our society. But perhaps this may be in itself a real argument for studying it. 
    It is the emotional questions that most need to be talked about. And, of course, besides understandable public anxieties, there is also the problem of personal 
    anguish. If you bear with me for a moment I would like to put on the record a <a href="Annotations.html#landersLetter">letter</a> a girl wrote to <a href="Annotations.html#annLanders">Ann Landers</a> a while ago--</p>
  <blockquote class="no-indent">Dear Ann Landers: I am a Lesbian. The word makes me sick, but there is nothing I can do about it. All I know is that I am 18 years old, and 
    I wish I were dead. I keep asking myself how I got this way and why it had to happen to me. Whenever I see a boy and girl holding hands, laughing and talking on a street corner, 
    I feel like throwing myself under the wheels of a truck.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>Don't suggest a psychiatrist. I couldn't afford one on my own, and I'd rather dies than tell my parents what is wrong with me. I don't know why I am writing to you, 
    because you can't help me. I guess I had to talk to somebody and you are the only one there is.</blockquote>
  <p class="uninterrupted">Of course professional people, and others too, come upon these cases from time to time. Unfortunately, they are often totally at sea as to what to do. 
     During an extensive survey I made of <a href="Annotations.html#Lincoln">Lincoln's</a> ministers and social workers they constantly emphasized that nothing in their training in colleges or seminaries had prepared 
    them at all for this kind of problem.</p>
  <p>It seemed to me that something needed to be done in the way of a course for prospective counsellors, social workers, doctors, ministers and even</p>

<p class="uninterrupted">police officers, and that this required a broad interdisciplinary knowledge of the subject. This meant not only a medical and legal approach but also one which showed how our 
          culture looked at the homosexual in such fields as creative literature. I was glad to see this sense of need for a broad approach confirmed in an important government document, the <a href="Annotations.html#homoReport">Report of the Task Force on Homosexuality</a> 
          of the National Institute of Mental Health, issued exactly a year ago, which argued for interdisciplinary courses, and mentioned particularly the need to study the effects on the public of "the portrayal of homosexual behavior, 
   attitudes, and values in literature and drama."</p>
     <p>The course at the university which covers psychiatry, morals, law, federal policy, cultural anthropology, sociology, history, and literature aims at providing 
        the student with a wide breadth of information and to analyze as many different points of view as possible. What views the student finally takes, if he takes any, will, 
        we hope, depend on his informed judgment, once he has seen all aspects of the subject.</p>
<p>Nor did we feel that information on homosexuality can be confined to doctors in medical schools. Everywhere, in the press, in magazines, on television, in the movies the general public 
   sees the problem directly presented. Grandmothers are writing to columnists to ask them to recommend books, and one new course for Sunday School students I have seen  has a unit 
   which deals frankly with the subject. But if America lacks knowledge on homosexuality, it does have 4 or 5 or 10 million homosexual citizens, depending on whose estimates you take. 
   The fact that they create problems that badly need study is borne home to everyone who thinks about the question.</p>

<p>Indeed, homosexuals in the United States are a very significant minority, perhaps the largets minority group after the Negro. What is more, young 
homosexuals, and by this I mean chiefly those of college age, are beginning to take a hard look at the facts of their existence. When they do this, what 
they see in store for them in future years is too often not the "understanding and justice for homosexuals" the Lutheran Church of America called for this summer at its national convention, but ostracism, ridicule and rejection.</p>
<p>What young people are doing in response to this realization is a new thing, so new that few people have even grasped it. They are banding together for discussions 
   and social activities and to work for their own betterment. There are now more than 60 college communities in the United States with student homosexual organizations that 
   hold regular meetings and dances. Like young people everywhere nowadays they are often impatient with society over the question of minority problems. This poses 
   the very real threat of disruptions and violence of which we have unfortunately seen so much recently. I cannot think of any better way for universities to demonstrate 
   a bona fide concern, and to offer a rational alternative to such deplorable events than by providing solidly conceived, well-staffed academic programs on homosexual 
   problems. The group of professional people that has been recruited at Lincoln, mainly senior members of their departments and services, and under the able direction of 
   <a href="Annotations.html#jamesCole">Prof. James Cole</a> of the Department of Psychology, shows that real local concern exists and that the challenge is being responsibly met 
   on at least one campus. I myself am proud of our leadership in a difficult new field, fraught with uncertainty and hope. I for one would like to think of Nebraska 
   as still a pioneering state in the 1970's.</p>
