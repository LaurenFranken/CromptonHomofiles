<div class="statement">Statement by Professor Louis Crompton for the University Archives on
         the introduction of the controversial Proseminar in Homophile Studies at the University
   of Nebraska at Lincoln in the fall of 1970</div>
      
      <p>The idea for this course came to <a href="Annotations.html#louisCrompton">me</a> at a conference at the <a href="Annotations.html#NebraskaCenter">Nebraska Center</a> in May, 1969. During a speech on university
         policy Vice Chancellor <a href="Annotations.html#merkHobson"> Merk Hobson</a>
         suggested that the university should sponsor interdisciplinary courses on social
         problems. Vice Chancellor Hobson was the soberest of engineers, hardly to be suspected
         of any radical proclivities. I am sure the issue of homosexuality was far from his
         mind,
         but I thought it would make a fine topic. At that time, as far as I know, no one had
         offered a course on the subject at any American (or foreign) university.</p>
      
      <p>I conceived the course as focusing on civil liberties issues, but I thought the material
         would be especially useful for social workers, counselors, clinical psychologists,
         and
         other members of the so-called helping professions, including the clergy. (I had,
         shortly before this, tried to start a Lincoln "Council on Religion and the Homosexual"
         on the model of a group in <a href="Annotations.html#SanFrancisco">San
            Francisco</a> but met with little success. Liberal Protestant
         ministers, for whom this was a very novel idea, were politely responsive but no
         homosexuals would participate--they were all then far too dep in the closet.) The
         sociology department immediately agreed to give credit for the course. <a href="Annotations.html#warrenCaldwell">Warren Caldwell</a>, chair of the
         anthropology department reacted enthusiastically to the idea and my own department
         (English) also co-sponsored the program. The department of psychology was not willing
         to
         authorize credit in psychology--I think they were worried about whether the course
         would
         be methodologically sound, but Professor <a href="Annotations.html#jamesCole">James
            Cole</a> was a strong and generous supporter of the project from the
         start.</p>
      
      <p>I also sought and received agreement to participate from <a href="Annotations.html#garnetLarson">Garnet Larson</a> (Graduate School of Social
         Work), <a href="Annotations.html#keithPrichard">Keith Prichard </a> (Teachers

         and <a href="Annotations.html#josephJulian">Joseph Julian</a> (Sociology),
         most of them senior University of Nebraska faculty. Later, guest lecturers were added,
         including a former chief of police from <a href="Annotations.html#Bloomington">Bloomington</a>, who spoke as a member of the <a href="Annotations.html#KinseyInstitute">Kinsey Institute of Indiana University</a>;
         <a href="Annotations.html#duaneSpiers">Duane Spiers</a> of the
         Department of Psychiatry, Creighton University School of Medicine; an officer in the

         homosexual civil rights organization, the nearest gay men I could then find.</p>
      
      <p>I was very surprised at the general willingness of faculty to back the course. I had
         experience to encounter at least a few doubters, and perhaps some direct opposition.
         But
         no faculty opposition came to my attention, except from one person (of whom I'll say
         something shortly). Dean of Faculties <a href="Annotations.html#peterMagrath">Peter
            Magrath </a>and President <a href="Annotations.html#josephSoshnik">
            Joseph Soshnik </a>were both immediately supportive. Since
         homosexuality at that particular time was perceived as a subject lying especially
         within
         the jurisdiction of the psychiatrist and psychologist, they suggested, however, that
         we
         might minimize political</p>

<p class="uninterrupted">criticism if the
         direction of the course was placed under a "troika" of myself, Jim Cole, and a
         psychiatrist in the University Student Health Center, Dr. <a href="Annotations.html#louisMartin">Louis Martin</a>. Though I did not accept the
         then official view of the <a href="Annotations.html#APA">American Psychiatric
            Association</a> as to the pathological nature of homosexuality (indeed
         one important theme of the course was to explore critique of this position <a href="Annotations.html#n1"> 1 </a><div class="editorial" id="n1"> 1 
            <p>The American Psychiatric
               Association took homosexuality off its list of mental illnesses in
               1974.</p>
         </div>) I had earlier established a working relation with Dr. Martin, so I
         readily agreed to the arrangement, which I realized was designed to protect me (and
         the
         university) from attack.</p>
      
      <p>Why did I suggest the course? From 1964 on I had close contact during the summer months
         with homosexual civil rights groups in San Francisco and had come to realize how many
         crippling sanctions American society maintained against homosexuals. These included
         prison sentences under state sodomy laws, a presidential <a href="Annotations.html#ExecutiveOrder">executive order</a> (issued by
         <a href="Annotations.html#dwightEisenhower">President Eisenhower</a>
         following the recommendation of a congressional "Subcommittee on the Employment of
         Homosexuals and Other Sex Perverts") barring employment of homosexuals by the federal
         government under any circumstances, exclusion and dishonorable discharges issued by
         the
         Armed Services, stigmatization by the medical profession, denial of citizenship and
         the
         threat of deportation by the immigration authorities, refusal of security clearances
         in
         a multitude of industries with government contracts, etc. I was also interested in
         the
         theological background for popular anti-homosexual sentiment. Most (but by no means
         all)
         of these discriminatory practices have since been abolished, but in 1970 very few
         educated people even knew they existed. My perhaps naive hope was that if decent people
         understood the depths of prejudice implied by these official positions, and were exposed
         to reasoned discussion of them, they would come to question them.</p>
      
      <p>Surprisingly, it did not occur to me until the course was a month or so in progress
         that
         there was a vast historical and literary side to the subject. I had not foreseen that
         I
         would be devoting decades of my life to these humanistic aspects.</p>
      
      <p>What caused the attacks on the course? To begin with, the objections of one
         regent,<a href="Annotations.html#richardHerman"> Richard Herman </a>of
         Omaha, alerted the public to the fact the course was being offered, since his protests
         received ample coverage in a press account of a meeting in which the regents finally
         agreed to approve the offering. The publicity, of course, helped enrollment, and 34
         students registered, representing a broad range of disciplines, as we had hoped. As
         I
         recall most were from the social sciences. All were juniors, seniors, or graduate
         students, since "proseminars" were open only to students on this level. Two campus
         clergymen, one the Episcopalian chaplain, the other (more surprisingly) a member of
         the
         conservative Missouri Synod Lutheran church enrolled.</p>
      
      
      <p>The official name of the course was "Proseminar in Homophile Studies: Anthropology,
         English, Sociology 171/172." A "proseminar" was the contemporary academic jargon for
         advanced undergraduate courses in which
         
         <div class="image"><a href="images/1992.History.3.jpg"><img src="images/thumbnails/1992.History.3.jpg"></img></a></div>
         <p class="right">3</p>

         <p class="uninterrupted"> students did research based on secondary sources. In 1970 courses carrying graduate
         credit at the University bore numbers in the 200 series. "Homophile" was a usage,
         rare
         then, and now obsolete, used to describe academic work on the subject of homosexuality,
         coined by <a href="Annotations.html#OneInstitute">One Institute</a> of Los
         Angeles, which offered such courses.</p>
      
      <p>It was a historical irony that the students who would have been most interested in
         the
         course were freshmen and not eligible to enroll. The high school students who entered
         the University of Nebraska in 1970 were perhaps the most radical in the state's history,
         since the Vietnam War, the black civil rights movement and the new women's movement
         had
         all combined to rouse the young. 1970 was also, co-incidentally, the year in which
         student gay groups first surfaced widely on college campuses in the wake of the
         <a href="Annotations.html#Stonewall">Stonewall Riots</a> on June,
         1969. But I did not, however, become aware of the amazing proliferation of student
         organizations until the summer of 1970, a few weeks before the course began. It had
         been
         originally conceived before I had imagined any such thing was possible.</p>
      
      <p>I have indicated that there was one faculty member known to me who had opposed the
         course during the approval hearings by academic committees. This was Prof.
         <a href="Annotations.html#philipCrowl">Philip Crowl</a> of the history
         department who was a member of the Graduate College committee which had to approve
         the
         course. The committee nevertheless voted in favor of the course, which had the strong
         support of the Assistant Dean of the Graduate College, <a href="Annotations.html#bejaminMcCashland">Benjamin McCashland</a>. I have no doubt
         as to the basis for Prof. Crowl's hostility. Having interviewed a number of men in
         San
         Francisco who had suffered severe hardships because of the dishonorable discharge
         they
         had received from the military and heard of similar cases in Lincoln, I had challenged
         the University of Nebraska <a href="Annotations.html#ROTC">ROTC</a> committee,
         which Prof. Crowl chaired, on their discriminatory policy. (Recently, in April, 1991,
         the UNL Academic Senate voted to protest this policy. In the late sixties, however,
         such
         protests were unheard of: gay male students wanted the exemptions from the draft that
         the exclusion provided.) A year or so after the hearings, Prof. Crowl happened to
         be
         seated next to me at a faculty dining table. He gratuitously volunteered the remark
         that
         the course would not have faced difficulties if I had stuck to literary matters and
         avoided raising other issues.</p>
      
      <p>We had no warning of State Senator <a href="Annotations.html#terryCarpenter">Terry
            Carpenter's</a> campaign against the course until a few weeks after
         school began. I can only speculate as to what motivated it. In the spring of 1970
         the
         shootings at<a href="Annotations.html#KentState">Kent State</a> had
         inspired a wave of campus protests against the war in Vietnam. These in turn aroused
         strong negative feelings toward students in supporters of the war, who were especially
         strong in the western part of Nebraska among Senator Carpenter's constituents. The
         senator himself was particularly antagonistic to anti-war students and sought to show
         his displeasure by campaigning against the incumbent regents in the November elections.
         In particular, he supported the candidacy of Dr. <a href="Annotations.html#robertProkop">Robert Prokop</a>, who made the new homophile course a political
         issue in seeking a seat on the Board of Regents. To help Prokop, Carpenter scheduled
         public hearings on the course a few days before the November election.</p>
      
<p>The name of Senator Carpenter will hardly be familiar to</p>

<p class="uninterrupted"> undergraduates today, but in his heyday he was by far
         the best known member of the Nebraska Legislature. His obstreperousness and curmudgeonly
         manner earned him the nickname "terrible Terry." His demeanor bore some resemblance
         to a
         now largely vanished breed of Southern demagogues and racists, but he was a maverick
         rather than a real conservative. It was often hard to guess what side he would take
         on
         an issue. He had been elected to the House of Representatives as a young man in 1932,
         but served only one term. He distinguished himself by praising <a href="Annotations.html#adolfHitler">Hitler</a>, and it was said that he was one of
         the few Democrats <a href="Annotations.html#franklinRoosevelt">Roosevelt</a>
         did not want to see re-elected. Thereafter he served in the Nebraska State House,
         which
         he regarded as a "bully pulpit" in a&nbsp;quite un-Roosevelt sense of the term. Time magazine
         once did a story on him as a political "character."</p>
      
      <p>The color for Carpenter's political campaign was the position he held on a legislative
         subcommittee on public health. In 1969 the legislature had passed a harsh new criminal
         <a href="Annotations.html#psychoLaw">law</a> pertaining to "sexual
         psychopaths." Both the courts and the attorney general found the law to be
         unconstitutional. Hearings were scheduled for October 28-30, shortly before the fall
         elections, and were to cover a wide range of issues--including the sexual psychopath
         law, pornography, and homosexuality in prisons. In addition Carpenter announced that
         he
         wanted to "get specific reasons why the University feels it should have a course on
         homosexuals." A week before the hearings Prokop took the public stand that the
         university was wrong in allowing a course on homosexuality to be taught by
         non-physicians. "A subject like this should not be an elective course for students
         unless they are studying in the medical field."&nbsp; The holder of the regional seat Prokop
         was seeking was another physician, <a href="Annotations.html#bejaminGreenberg">Dr. Ben H.
            Greenberg</a> of York. Dr. Greenburg, defending the course, argued
         that it would be valuable to lawyers, policemen, social workers, clinical psychologists,
         and the clergy. Such knowledge, he held, "should extend beyond the medical campus."
         (Omaha World Herald, Oct. 23). But Prokop and Greenberg were not the only public figures
         drawn into the debate. State Senator <a href="Annotations.html#haroldSimpson">Harold
            Simpson</a>, whose district included the University of Nebraska, made
         a public statement in opposition to the course, and Governor <a href="Annotations.html#norbertTiemann">Norbert Tiemann</a> (a moderate Republican)
         announced that he was "personally" opposed to it, while that the issue was not for
         his
         office but the regents to deal with. (Sunday Lincoln Journal-Star, Oct. 4).</p>
      
      <p>The public attack led some students to come to my office to offer their support in
         October shortly before the hearings. Leaders of the group were <a href="Annotations.html#josephCreason">Joe Creason</a> and <a href="Annotations.html#davidMacIntosh">David MacIntosh</a> (then both freshmen, and
         now both dead from AIDS) and a lesbian junior (who was enrolled in the course). Though
         I
         was very glad to see a student group form at UNL, I advised them that the appearance
         on
         campus of a gay organization a few days before the regents' election would probably
         only
         add fuel to the flames and advised them to wait until January to seek formal
         recognition. (During the course of the semester the lesbian student's parents discovered
         a love letter from a friend of hers. They insisted that she seek treatment from a
         psychiatrist who would cure her or leave home. Pained and shaken by the confrontation,
         she left. Years later she visited me: she was a successful landscape gardener; her
         father was dead but she was reconciled with her mother, who now held different views
         from what she had learned in her psychology class.)</p>

<div class="image"><a href="images/1992.History.5.jpg"><img src="images/thumbnails/1992.History.5.jpg"></img></a></div>
      <p class="right">5</p>
      
      <p>It was generally held that the university counsel could have got the hearings quashed
         by
         the courts on the grounds that they were an unconstitutional abuse of legislative
         powers. However, it was felt that such action would have have been politically unwise,
         since it might have suggested that the university had something to hide. Consequently,
         it was decided to co-operate with the hearings, though their patently political aim
         was
         obvious. Carpenter "invited" the entire Board of Regents, leading administrative
         officers of the university and all the faculty who participated in the course to appear
         at the hearings, under threat of subpoena.</p>
      
      <p>As a result a large number of people spent a full day in the <a href="Annotations.html#OmahaCourt">Omaha Federal Courthouse</a> being grilled by
         Carpenter and another state senator, <a href="Annotations.html#henryPedersen">Henry
            Pedersen</a> of Omaha. This was an uncomfortable and nerve-wracking
         encounter but also a somewhat comic one in retrospect. The senators had no clear idea
         what questions to ask, and some of the faculty, who had not yet prepared their lectures
         in the course, were equally at sea. It was largely a "fishing expedition" among fish
         who
         were by no means willing to bite.</p>
      
      <p>The day's most dramatic confrontation involved Dean Magrath. A week or so before the
         hearings Carpenter had asked the dean for a list of the students in the course. I
         objected that providing the names would allow Carpenter to harass the students and
         their
         parents, and that the request should be resisted. (There had been court cases which
         established that legislative investigators did not have the right to lists of members
         of
         controversial student organizations.) At the hearings in Omaha Carpenter several times
         angrily demanded that Magrath give him the list and Magrath adamantly and courageously
         refused. Magrath pointed out the university policy made students' course registrations
         confidential, that all of the students were at least 20 and the averaged age close
         to
         23. Carpenter announced publicly that he wished to inform students' parents. In the
         case
         of the few gay and lesbian students in the course this could have led to further
         tragedies.</p>
      
      <p>I might mention that Carpenter had hoped to have television coverage of the hearings
         but
         the news cameras were pre-empted by an unexpected visit of <a href="Annotations.html#richardNixon">President Nixon</a> to Omaha that day. Newsmen
         jokingly called this turn of events "Nixon's revenge" since Carpenter had prevented
         Nixon from receiving a unanimous vote for nomination at the Republican national
         convention in 1968 by nominating an imaginary "Joe Smith." Carpenter was reportedly
         very
         angry with <a href="Annotations.html#jackMcBride">Jack McBride</a>, of
         Nebraska Educational Television, for refusing to televise the hearings on public
         television.</p>
      
      <p>On the eve of the hearings the campus newspaper, the <a href="Annotations.html#Nebraskan">Nebraskan</a>, reported Carpenter's comment that "It's a sad
         commentary when the faculty, irrespective of the wishes of the Chancellor and the
         Board
         of Regents, can push through such a course." (The course had in fact passed through
         a
         very elaborate review procedure, being scrutinized by various curriculum committees,
         and
         eventually by the regents who were nervous about it but eventually approved it as
         academically justified.) Carpenter said that "in extensive talks" he had found "no
         one
         who favors the course. The Regents don't obviously know all that's going on in the
         University. They don't have the staff to keep them informed." The newly installed
         Chancellor of the 
         
        <div class="image"><a href="images/1992.History.6.jpg"><img src="images/thumbnails/1992.History.6.jpg"></img></a></div>
         <p class="right">6</p>

<p class="uninterrupted">university, <a href="Annotations.html#durwardVarner"> D. B. Varner</a>, who had the misfortune to
         arrive on campus in the middle of the controversy, replied to questions about the
         course
         with marked discomfort. Remarking that he'd rather talk about the budget, Varner
         admitted "I wish I didn't have to defend it," but added, rather limply, "but if
         questions are raised I will have to defend the course."</p>
      
      <p>At the hearing on October 29 Dr. Greenberg opined that homosexuality was an "emotional
         cancer" and a "scourge on humanity" and declared that the course would not attempt
         to
         promote homosexuality or indoctrinate students. Carpenter complained that the regents
         simply rubber stamped faculty decisions. "The people ought to understand who's running
         the university, and it's not the regents." (Lincoln Evening Journal, Oct. 30). Carpenter
         struck an alarmist note by remarking that "A nationwide movement is under way to make
         abnormal forms of behavior acceptable." Prokop was pointedly invited to testify and
         said
         that when he was a medical school he had received only 15 minutes of training on
         homosexuality, implying that this was ample. "Since homosexuality is medical and
         psychiatric problem," he held that "there would be more value in offering such a course
         just for medical students." (OWH, Oct. 30)</p>
      
      <p>The reporting in the campus paper provided a livelier and more candid account of the
         day's hearings. It described Carpenter as "thundering," after the morning session:
         "This
         course will not have a long life if I have my way. The Board of Regents will rue the
         day
         they ever thought of it." It quote him as saying in the course of the hearings, "I
         am
         completely without knowledge in this matter. I have have had no contact with
         homosexuals." The senator's penchant for crudely flamboyant political rhetoric came
         out
         in his contention that only an instructor who had had homosexual experience could
         teach
         the course. "I would think that all these instructors ought to go out and try it if
         they're going to teach it."</p>
      
      <p>Carpenter was not alone on the legislative bench at the hearings. He shared the
         interrogator's role with Senator <a href="Annotations.html#henryPedersen">Henry
            Pedersen</a>of Omaha, chair of the Legislative Health Committee, whom
         the Nebraskan also quoted: "For a long time it was understood that a queer was a queer.
         Do you have to have a 40-hour course to be told that there are nice literary queers
         as
         well as dirty queers? I hope this course teaches that homosexuality is abnormal conduct
         and should be avoided."</p>
      
      <p>Besides this news item the Nebraskan carried a column by its editor, an English major
         who was enrolled in the course. By way of proof that Carpenter had come to the hearings
         with a closed mind, the editor cited a statement he had made before they began to
         the
         effect that he intended "to introduce a bill at the next legislature that forbids
         the
         teaching of a course in homosexuality except in medical schools and I want to see
         a
         single senator in homosexuality except in medical schools and I want to see a single
         who
         will vote against it." When James Cole sought to talk about the etiology of
         homosexuality from a professional psychologist's point of view, Carpenter had
         impatiently interrupted him, asking for the "nitty-gritty." "What's it like?" he wanted
         to know. "How many positions are there?" Characterizing Carpenter as a man with a
         "finely honed political sense, dull mind, and blunt approach," the editor praised
         the
         dignity and restraint of the course's defenders: "The administrators, regents, and
         instructors who were called to</p>

<p class="uninterrupted">testify
         performed admirably despite all the harassment and abuse. Standing center ring in
         Carpenter's private circus, they let the clown trap himself in a web of contradictions,
         malice nonsense."</p>
      
      <p>(Never shy about using his legislative authority, Carpenter reacted to the Nebraskan's
         coverage by introducing a bill to keep it from receiving funding from student fees,
         its
         main source of revenue. The bill failed to survive a committee hearing.)</p>
      
      <p>The "circus" continued another day. On this second day Carpenter introduced a new
         threat. He had been one of the supporters of a bill which had in 1969 legalized tenure
         for university professors. Now he declared that he had made a mistake and would try
         to
         repeal this measure during the new legislative season. More testimony was given about
         the course, this time with no defenders on hand, since they had been dismissed the
         day
         before. As his main witness, Carpenter called <a href="Annotations.html#robertOsborne">Dr.
            Robert Osborne</a>, the state's top medical officer, who expressed
         his doubts about offering a course on homosexuality: "the key question was whether
         the
         course would encourage students to become homosexual." The head of the Nebraska State
         Patrol, Col. <a href="Annotations.html#jamesKruger">J. E. Kruger</a>, went
         further, saying he "feared the course might attract persons with abnormal tendencies
         to
         Nebraska and this may lead to more violent acts" (Lincoln Star, Oct. 31).</p>
      
      <p>The course was not without its defenders in the press. Regent <a href="Annotations.html#edwardSchwartzkopf">Edward Schwartzkopf</a> of Lincoln, who
         was not up for re-election, took the public stand that courses of this sort were highly
         desirable, and ought to be given at other colleges. Some strong letters of support
         appeared in the local press, including one from the Rev. <a href="Annotations.html#laryDoerr">Larry Doerr</a> of the <a href="Annotations.html#UMHE">United Ministries in Higher Education</a>, which was
         co-signed by the two ministers who had taken the course. (The Lutheran later wrote
         a
         conservative theological paper for credit which I thought was the best researched
         in the
         class: I gave him an A.) Dean Magrath gave a thoughtful and eloquent public speech
         defending the course on educational and philosophical grounds, but none of these efforts
         managed to stem the tide of popular disapproval.</p>
      
      <p>Editorials in Lincoln's two daily papers after the election tried to put matters in
         perspective. <a href="Annotations.html#williamDobler">William O. Dobler</a>,
         writing in the Lincoln Star, took a philosophical stance. "How very unfortunate it
         is,"
         he wrote, "that all the people of Nebraska do not have the opportunity to read the
         excellent speech delivered by Dr. C. Peter Magrath, dean of faculties, at a campus
         conference late this week. The speech by Dr. Magrath is so many things--an insight
         into
         academic progress at Nebraska, a plea for understanding, an explanation of the
         interrelationships that constitute higher education and most prominently a defense
         of
         the 'proseminar in homophile studies,' better known as the new NU course in
         homosexuality." Dobler regretted that an understanding of the need for the course
         "will
         never be possible throughout most of Nebraska." "For this reason we are sorry that
         the
         course is now a part of the university's curriculum. Our own opinion is that a wiser
         course of action would have been to forego the homophile studies offering at this
         time."
         Dobler deplored the fact that his view was a "sacrifice to practicality' and a
         "compromise of one's principles."</p>

      <blockquote>[The] course was an attempt to promote understanding of the subject of homosexuality
      on
      the part of advanced students whose careers can be expected to bring them in touch
      with
      this human problem. There are in our country millions of homosexuals, constituting
      a
      problem group equal, perhaps, or possibly exceeding the impoverished or various minority
      groups. The remarkable thing is that we do not want to better understand it so we
      might
      better deal with it. . . . There is no matter or issue in the world that we can
      effectively meet without all the knowledge and understanding of which we are capable.
      .
      . . Establishment of the homophile course was an enlightened action but an impractical
         one, a contradiction that has to stand as a discredit to the state."</blockquote>
      
      <p>An editorial in the Lincoln Journal three days later sounded a more urgent note:</p>
      <blockquote>Ramifications of the University of Nebraska's controversial course on homosexuality
      go
      far beyond the merits or demerits of the course itself. They bear on the very structure
      and integrity of higher education in Nebraska. In his assault on the course Sen. Terry
      Carpenter vows to seek legislation (1) stopping the course and (2) repealing the law
      which gives tenure to faculty members at state institutions of higher learning. If
      the
      legislature were to go along with this dual attack, it would be preempting authority
      over both curriculum and personnel. The consequences are obvious--and horrendous.
      . . .
      This would make the University the political football of the Legislature. It would
      destroy the University in short order. It is, in short, an eventuality to be avoided
      at
         all costs.</blockquote>
      
      <p>By a parliamentary maneuver, Carpenter's bill was called up for a vote in the spring
         of
         1971 by members of the legislature opposed to it. It was defeated. The proposal to
         abolish tenure was never introduced.</p>
      
      <p>The homophile course was not repeated. I felt I could not ask faculty to face more
         harassment. Moreover, it so happened that in 1970 the university had no course in
         human
         sexuality in the general sense. This seemed anomalous, and Professor Cole decided
         that
         he was now interested in giving one. For more than a decade, until my retirement,
         I
         participated in this new course, presenting the material on homosexuality. I also
         gave a
         <a href="Annotations.html#LitCourse">course</a> on homosexuality in
         literature in the English department from 1973 until 1988.</p>
      
      <p>In retrospect the course seems to me to have been a worthwhile idea that happened
         to
         come at a politically inauspicious moment. In the event both Greenberg and another
         incumbent regent were defeated in the election. But so were all the incumbents of
         the
         State Board of Education, which had nothing do do with the course, since
         it controlled only the three state colleges and not the university. The public was
         in an
         anti-student mood because of nationwide campus anti-war disturbances, and voted against
         incumbents, conservative and liberal alike. If the course had been introduced two
         or
         three years later, it might not have been seriously challenged. As it turned out,
         the
         experiment had the mixed result of persuading a few academics (most notably Professor
         Cole) to take a serious professional interest in the subject, while scaring others
         off.
         In my own case, I determined that for the</p>

<p class="uninterrupted">rest
         of my academic career I would do no new research or writing that did not deal with
         the
   historical, literary, or social aspects of homosexuality.</p>
