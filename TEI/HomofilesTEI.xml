         <p rend="underline">Statement by Professor Louis Crompton for the University Archives on
            the introduction of the controversial Proseminar in Homophile Studies at the University
            of Nebraska at Lincoln in the fall of 1970</p>
         <p>The idea for this course came to <persName><ref target="#louisCrompton"
               >me</ref></persName> at a conference at the <placeName><ref target="#NebraskaCenter"
                  >Nebraska Center</ref></placeName> in May, 1969. During a speech on university
            policy Vice Chancellor <persName><ref target="#merkHobson"> Merk Hobson</ref></persName>
            suggested that the university should sponsor interdisciplinary courses on social
            problems. Vice Chancellor Hobson was the soberest of engineers, hardly to be suspected
            of any radical proclivities. I am sure the issue of homosexuality was far from his mind,
            but I thought it would make a fine topic. At that time, as far as I know, no one had
            offered a course on the subject at any American (or foreign) university.</p>
         <p>I conceived the course as focusing on civil liberties issues, but I thought the material
            would be especially useful for social workers, counselors, clinical psychologists, and
            other members of the so-called helping professions, including the clergy. (I had,
            shortly before this, tried to start a Lincoln "Council on Religion and the Homosexual"
            on the model of a group in<placeName><ref target="#SanFrancisco"> San
               Francisco</ref></placeName> but met with little success. Liberal Protestant
            ministers, for whom this was a very novel idea, were politely responsive but no
            homosexuals would participate--they were all then far too dep in the closet.) The
            sociology department immediately agreed to give credit for the course. <persName><ref
                  target="#warrenCaldwell">Warren Caldwell</ref></persName>, chair of the
            anthropology department reacted enthusiastically to the idea and my own department
            (English) also co-sponsored the program. The department of psychology was not willing to
            authorize credit in psychology--I think they were worried about whether the course would
            be methodologically sound, but Professor <persName><ref target="#jamesCole">James
                  Cole</ref></persName> was a strong and generous supporter of the project from the
            start.</p>

            homosexual civil rights organization, the nearest gay men I could then find.</p>
         <p>I was very surprised at the general willingness of faculty to back the course. I had
            experience to encounter at least a few doubters, and perhaps some direct opposition. But
            no faculty opposition came to my attention, except from one person (of whom I'll say
            something shortly). Dean of Faculties <persName><ref target="#peterMagrath">Peter

                  Joseph Soshnik </ref></persName>were both immediately supportive. Since
            homosexuality at that particular time was perceived as a subject lying especially within
            the jurisdiction of the psychiatrist and psychologist, they suggested, however, that we
            might minimize political<lb/><pb facs="1992.History.2.jpg"/><lb/>criticism if the
            direction of the course was placed under a "troika" of myself, Jim Cole, and a
            psychiatrist in the University Student Health Center, Dr. <persName><ref
                  target="#louisMartin">Louis Martin</ref></persName>. Though I did not accept the
            then official view of the <orgName><ref target="#APA">American Psychiatric
                  Association</ref></orgName> as to the pathological nature of homosexuality (indeed
            one important theme of the course was to explore critique of this position <ref n="1"

            readily agreed to the arrangement, which I realized was designed to protect me (and the
            university) from attack.</p>
         <p>Why did I suggest the course? From 1964 on I had close contact during the summer months
            with homosexual civil rights groups in San Francisco and had come to realize how many
            crippling sanctions American society maintained against homosexuals. These included
            prison sentences under state sodomy laws, a presidential <objectName><ref
                  target="#ExecutiveOrder">executive order</ref></objectName> (issued by
                  <persName><ref target="#dwightEisenhower">President Eisenhower</ref></persName>
            following the recommendation of a congressional "Subcommittee on the Employment of
            Homosexuals and Other Sex Perverts") barring employment of homosexuals by the federal
            government under any circumstances, exclusion and dishonorable discharges issued by the
            Armed Services, stigmatization by the medical profession, denial of citizenship and the
            threat of deportation by the immigration authorities, refusal of security clearances in
            a multitude of industries with government contracts, etc. I was also interested in the
            theological background for popular anti-homosexual sentiment. Most (but by no means all)
            of these discriminatory practices have since been abolished, but in 1970 very few
            educated people even knew they existed. My perhaps naive hope was that if decent people
            understood the depths of prejudice implied by these official positions, and were exposed
            to reasoned discussion of them, they would come to question them.</p>
         <p>Surprisingly, it did not occur to me until the course was a month or so in progress that
            there was a vast historical and literary side to the subject. I had not foreseen that I
            would be devoting decades of my life to these humanistic aspects.</p>
         <p>What caused the attacks on the course? To begin with, the objections of one
                  regent,<persName><ref target="#richardHerman"> Richard Herman </ref></persName>of
            Omaha, alerted the public to the fact the course was being offered, since his protests
            received ample coverage in a press account of a meeting in which the regents finally
            agreed to approve the offering. The publicity, of course, helped enrollment, and 34
            students registered, representing a broad range of disciplines, as we had hoped. As I
            recall most were from the social sciences. All were juniors, seniors, or graduate
            students, since "proseminars" were open only to students on this level. Two campus
            clergymen, one the Episcopalian chaplain, the other (more surprisingly) a member of the
            conservative Missouri Synod Lutheran church enrolled.</p>

         <p>The official name of the course was "Proseminar in Homophile Studies: Anthropology,
            English, Sociology 171/172." A "proseminar" was the contemporary academic jargon for
            advanced undergraduate courses in which<lb/><pb facs="1992.History.3.jpg"/><lb/>
            students did research based on secondary sources. In 1970 courses carrying graduate
            credit at the University bore numbers in the 200 series. "Homophile" was a usage, rare
            then, and now obsolete, used to describe academic work on the subject of homosexuality,
            coined by <orgName><ref target="#OneInstitute">One Institute</ref></orgName> of Los
            Angeles, which offered such courses.</p>
         <p>It was a historical irony that the students who would have been most interested in the
            course were freshmen and not eligible to enroll. The high school students who entered
            the University of Nebraska in 1970 were perhaps the most radical in the state's history,
            since the Vietnam War, the black civil rights movement and the new women's movement had
            all combined to rouse the young. 1970 was also, co-incidentally, the year in which
            student gay groups first surfaced widely on college campuses in the wake of the
                  <placeName><ref target="#Stonewall">Stonewall Riots</ref></placeName> on June,
            1969. But I did not, however, become aware of the amazing proliferation of student
            organizations until the summer of 1970, a few weeks before the course began. It had been
            originally conceived before I had imagined any such thing was possible.</p>
         <p>I have indicated that there was one faculty member known to me who had opposed the
            course during the approval hearings by academic committees. This was Prof.
                  <persName><ref target="#philipCrowl">Philip Crowl</ref></persName> of the history
            department who was a member of the Graduate College committee which had to approve the
            course. The committee nevertheless voted in favor of the course, which had the strong
            support of the Assistant Dean of the Graduate College, <persName><ref
                  target="#bejaminMcCashland">Benjamin McCashland</ref></persName>. I have no doubt
            as to the basis for Prof. Crowl's hostility. Having interviewed a number of men in San
            Francisco who had suffered severe hardships because of the dishonorable discharge they
            had received from the military and heard of similar cases in Lincoln, I had challenged
            the University of Nebraska <orgName><ref target="#ROTC">ROTC</ref></orgName> committee,
            which Prof. Crowl chaired, on their discriminatory policy. (Recently, in April, 1991,
            the UNL Academic Senate voted to protest this policy. In the late sixties, however, such
            protests were unheard of: gay male students wanted the exemptions from the draft that
            the exclusion provided.) A year or so after the hearings, Prof. Crowl happened to be
            seated next to me at a faculty dining table. He gratuitously volunteered the remark that
            the course would not have faced difficulties if I had stuck to literary matters and
            avoided raising other issues.</p>
         <p>We had no warning of State Senator <persName><ref target="#terryCarpenter">Terry
                  Carpenter's</ref></persName> campaign against the course until a few weeks after
            school began. I can only speculate as to what motivated it. In the spring of 1970 the
            shootings at<placeName><ref target="#KentState">Kent State</ref></placeName> had
            inspired a wave of campus protests against the war in Vietnam. These in turn aroused
            strong negative feelings toward students in supporters of the war, who were especially
            strong in the western part of Nebraska among Senator Carpenter's constituents. The
            senator himself was particularly antagonistic to anti-war students and sought to show
            his displeasure by campaigning against the incumbent regents in the November elections.
            In particular, he supported the candidacy of Dr. <persName><ref target="#robertProkop"
                  >Robert Prokop</ref></persName>, who made the new homophile course a political
            issue in seeking a seat on the Board of Regents. To help Prokop, Carpenter scheduled
            public hearings on the course a few days before the November election.</p>
         <p>The name of Senator Carpenter will hardly be familiar to <lb/><pb
               facs="1992.History.4.jpg"/><lb/>undergraduates today, but in his heyday he was by far
            the best known member of the Nebraska Legislature. His obstreperousness and curmudgeonly
            manner earned him the nickname "terrible Terry." His demeanor bore some resemblance to a
            now largely vanished breed of Southern demagogues and racists, but he was a maverick
            rather than a real conservative. It was often hard to guess what side he would take on
            an issue. He had been elected to the House of Representatives as a young man in 1932,
            but served only one term. He distinguished himself by praising <persName><ref
                  target="#adolfHitler">Hitler</ref></persName>, and it was said that he was one of
            the few Democrats <persName><ref target="#franklinRoosevelt">Roosevelt</ref></persName>
            did not want to see re-elected. Thereafter he served in the Nebraska State House, which
            he regarded as a "bully pulpit" in a quite un-Roosevelt sense of the term. Time magazine
            once did a story on him as a political "character."</p>
         <p>The color for Carpenter's political campaign was the position he held on a legislative
            subcommittee on public health. In 1969 the legislature had passed a harsh new criminal
                  <objectName><ref target="#psychoLaw">law</ref></objectName> pertaining to "sexual
            psychopaths." Both the courts and the attorney general found the law to be
            unconstitutional. Hearings were scheduled for October 28-30, shortly before the fall
            elections, and were to cover a wide range of issues--including the sexual psychopath
            law, pornography, and homosexuality in prisons. In addition Carpenter announced that he
            wanted to "get specific reasons why the University feels it should have a course on
            homosexuals." A week before the hearings Prokop took the public stand that the
            university was wrong in allowing a course on homosexuality to be taught by
            non-physicians. "A subject like this should not be an elective course for students
            unless they are studying in the medical field."  The holder of the regional seat Prokop
            was seeking was another physician, <persName><ref target="#bejaminGreenberg">Dr. Ben H.
                  Greenberg</ref></persName> of York. Dr. Greenburg, defending the course, argued
            that it would be valuable to lawyers, policemen, social workers, clinical psychologists,
            and the clergy. Such knowledge, he held, "should extend beyond the medical campus."
            (Omaha World Herald, Oct. 23). But Prokop and Greenberg were not the only public figures
            drawn into the debate. State Senator <persName><ref target="#haroldSimpson">Harold
                  Simpson</ref></persName>, whose district included the University of Nebraska, made
            a public statement in opposition to the course, and Governor <persName><ref
                  target="#norbertTiemann">Norbert Tiemann</ref></persName> (a moderate Republican)
            announced that he was "personally" opposed to it, while that the issue was not for his
            office but the regents to deal with. (Sunday Lincoln Journal-Star, Oct. 4).</p>
         <p>The public attack led some students to come to my office to offer their support in
            October shortly before the hearings. Leaders of the group were <persName><ref
                  target="#josephCreason">Joe Creason</ref></persName> and <persName><ref
                  target="#davidMacIntosh">David MacIntosh</ref></persName> (then both freshmen, and
            now both dead from AIDS) and a lesbian junior (who was enrolled in the course). Though I
            was very glad to see a student group form at UNL, I advised them that the appearance on
            campus of a gay organization a few days before the regents' election would probably only
            add fuel to the flames and advised them to wait until January to seek formal
            recognition. (During the course of the semester the lesbian student's parents discovered
            a love letter from a friend of hers. They insisted that she seek treatment from a
            psychiatrist who would cure her or leave home. Pained and shaken by the confrontation,
            she left. Years later she visited me: she was a successful landscape gardener; her
            father was dead but she was reconciled with her mother, who now held different views
            from what she had learned in her psychology class.)</p>
         <lb/>
         <pb facs="1992.History.5"/>
         <lb/>
         <p>It was generally held that the university counsel could have got the hearings quashed by
            the courts on the grounds that they were an unconstitutional abuse of legislative
            powers. However, it was felt that such action would have have been politically unwise,
            since it might have suggested that the university had something to hide. Consequently,
            it was decided to co-operate with the hearings, though their patently political aim was
            obvious. Carpenter "invited" the entire Board of Regents, leading administrative
            officers of the university and all the faculty who participated in the course to appear
            at the hearings, under threat of subpoena.</p>
         <p>As a result a large number of people spent a full day in the <placeName><ref
                  target="#OmahaCourt">Omaha Federal Courthouse</ref></placeName> being grilled by
            Carpenter and another state senator, <persName><ref target="#henryPedersen">Henry
                  Pedersen</ref></persName> of Omaha. This was an uncomfortable and nerve-wracking
            encounter but also a somewhat comic one in retrospect. The senators had no clear idea
            what questions to ask, and some of the faculty, who had not yet prepared their lectures
            in the course, were equally at sea. It was largely a "fishing expedition" among fish who
            were by no means willing to bite.</p>
         <p>The day's most dramatic confrontation involved Dean Magrath. A week or so before the
            hearings Carpenter had asked the dean for a list of the students in the course. I
            objected that providing the names would allow Carpenter to harass the students and their
            parents, and that the request should be resisted. (There had been court cases which
            established that legislative investigators did not have the right to lists of members of
            controversial student organizations.) At the hearings in Omaha Carpenter several times
            angrily demanded that Magrath give him the list and Magrath adamantly and courageously
            refused. Magrath pointed out the university policy made students' course registrations
            confidential, that all of the students were at least 20 and the averaged age close to
            23. Carpenter announced publicly that he wished to inform students' parents. In the case
            of the few gay and lesbian students in the course this could have led to further
            tragedies.</p>
         <p>I might mention that Carpenter had hoped to have television coverage of the hearings but
            the news cameras were pre-empted by an unexpected visit of <persName><ref
                  target="#richardNixon">President Nixon</ref></persName> to Omaha that day. Newsmen
            jokingly called this turn of events "Nixon's revenge" since Carpenter had prevented
            Nixon from receiving a unanimous vote for nomination at the Republican national
            convention in 1968 by nominating an imaginary "Joe Smith." Carpenter was reportedly very
            angry with <persName><ref target="#jackMcBride">Jack McBride</ref></persName>, of
            Nebraska Educational Television, for refusing to televise the hearings on public
            television.</p>
         <p>On the eve of the hearings the campus newspaper, the <orgName><ref target="#Nebraskan"
                  >Nebraskan</ref></orgName>, reported Carpenter's comment that "It's a sad
            commentary when the faculty, irrespective of the wishes of the Chancellor and the Board
            of Regents, can push through such a course." (The course had in fact passed through a
            very elaborate review procedure, being scrutinized by various curriculum committees, and
            eventually by the regents who were nervous about it but eventually approved it as
            academically justified.) Carpenter said that "in extensive talks" he had found "no one
            who favors the course. The Regents don't obviously know all that's going on in the
            University. They don't have the staff to keep them informed." The newly installed
            Chancellor of the <lb/><pb facs="1992.History.6.jpg"/><lb/> university, <persName><ref
                  target="#durwardVarner"> D. B. Varner</ref></persName>, who had the misfortune to
            arrive on campus in the middle of the controversy, replied to questions about the course
            with marked discomfort. Remarking that he'd rather talk about the budget, Varner
            admitted "I wish I didn't have to defend it," but added, rather limply, "but if
            questions are raised I will have to defend the course."</p>
         <p>At the hearing on October 29 Dr. Greenberg opined that homosexuality was an "emotional
            cancer" and a "scourge on humanity" and declared that the course would not attempt to
            promote homosexuality or indoctrinate students. Carpenter complained that the regents
            simply rubber stamped faculty decisions. "The people ought to understand who's running
            the university, and it's not the regents." (Lincoln Evening Journal, Oct. 30). Carpenter
            struck an alarmist note by remarking that "A nationwide movement is under way to make
            abnormal forms of behavior acceptable." Prokop was pointedly invited to testify and said
            that when he was a medical school he had received only 15 minutes of training on
            homosexuality, implying that this was ample. "Since homosexuality is medical and
            psychiatric problem," he held that "there would be more value in offering such a course
            just for medical students." (OWH, Oct. 30)</p>
         <p>The reporting in the campus paper provided a livelier and more candid account of the
            day's hearings. It described Carpenter as "thundering," after the morning session: "This
            course will not have a long life if I have my way. The Board of Regents will rue the day
            they ever thought of it." It quote him as saying in the course of the hearings, "I am
            completely without knowledge in this matter. I have have had no contact with
            homosexuals." The senator's penchant for crudely flamboyant political rhetoric came out
            in his contention that only an instructor who had had homosexual experience could teach
            the course. "I would think that all these instructors ought to go out and try it if
            they're going to teach it."</p>
         <p>Carpenter was not alone on the legislative bench at the hearings. He shared the
            interrogator's role with Senator<persName><ref target="#henryPedersen">Henry
                  Pedersen</ref></persName>of Omaha, chair of the Legislative Health Committee, whom
            the Nebraskan also quoted: "For a long time it was understood that a queer was a queer.
            Do you have to have a 40-hour course to be told that there are nice literary queers as
            well as dirty queers? I hope this course teaches that homosexuality is abnormal conduct
            and should be avoided."</p>
         <p>Besides this news item the Nebraskan carried a column by its editor, an English major
            who was enrolled in the course. By way of proof that Carpenter had come to the hearings
            with a closed mind, the editor cited a statement he had made before they began to the
            effect that he intended "to introduce a bill at the next legislature that forbids the
            teaching of a course in homosexuality except in medical schools and I want to see a
            single senator in homosexuality except in medical schools and I want to see a single who
            will vote against it." When James Cole sought to talk about the etiology of
            homosexuality from a professional psychologist's point of view, Carpenter had
            impatiently interrupted him, asking for the "nitty-gritty." "What's it like?" he wanted
            to know. "How many positions are there?" Characterizing Carpenter as a man with a
            "finely honed political sense, dull mind, and blunt approach," the editor praised the
            dignity and restraint of the course's defenders: "The administrators, regents, and
            instructors who were called to <lb/><pb facs="1992.History.7.jpg"/><lb/>testify
            performed admirably despite all the harassment and abuse. Standing center ring in
            Carpenter's private circus, they let the clown trap himself in a web of contradictions,
            malice nonsense."</p>
         <p>(Never shy about using his legislative authority, Carpenter reacted to the Nebraskan's
            coverage by introducing a bill to keep it from receiving funding from student fees, its
            main source of revenue. The bill failed to survive a committee hearing.)</p>
         <p>The "circus" continued another day. On this second day Carpenter introduced a new
            threat. He had been one of the supporters of a bill which had in 1969 legalized tenure
            for university professors. Now he declared that he had made a mistake and would try to
            repeal this measure during the new legislative season. More testimony was given about
            the course, this time with no defenders on hand, since they had been dismissed the day
            before. As his main witness, Carpenter called <persName><ref target="#robertOsborne">Dr.
                  Robert Osborne</ref></persName>, the state's top medical officer, who expressed
            his doubts about offering a course on homosexuality: "the key question was whether the
            course would encourage students to become homosexual." The head of the Nebraska State
            Patrol, Col. <persName><ref target="#jamesKruger">J. E. Kruger</ref></persName>, went
            further, saying he "feared the course might attract persons with abnormal tendencies to
            Nebraska and this may lead to more violent acts" (Lincoln Star, Oct. 31).</p>
         <p>The course was not without its defenders in the press. Regent <persName><ref
                  target="#edwardSchwartzkopf">Edward Schwartzkopf</ref></persName> of Lincoln, who
            was not up for re-election, took the public stand that courses of this sort were highly
            desirable, and ought to be given at other colleges. Some strong letters of support
            appeared in the local press, including one from the Rev. <persName><ref
                  target="#laryDoerr">Larry Doerr</ref></persName> of the <orgName><ref
                  target="#UMHE">United Ministries in Higher Education</ref></orgName>, which was
            co-signed by the two ministers who had taken the course. (The Lutheran later wrote a
            conservative theological paper for credit which I thought was the best researched in the
            class: I gave him an A.) Dean Magrath gave a thoughtful and eloquent public speech
            defending the course on educational and philosophical grounds, but none of these efforts
            managed to stem the tide of popular disapproval.</p>
         <p>Editorials in Lincoln's two daily papers after the election tried to put matters in
            perspective. <persName><ref target="#williamDobler">William O. Dobler</ref></persName>,
            writing in the Lincoln Star, took a philosophical stance. "How very unfortunate it is,"
            he wrote, "that all the people of Nebraska do not have the opportunity to read the
            excellent speech delivered by Dr. C. Peter Magrath, dean of faculties, at a campus
            conference late this week. The speech by Dr. Magrath is so many things--an insight into
            academic progress at Nebraska, a plea for understanding, an explanation of the
            interrelationships that constitute higher education and most prominently a defense of
            the 'proseminar in homophile studies,' better known as the new NU course in
            homosexuality." Dobler regretted that an understanding of the need for the course "will
            never be possible throughout most of Nebraska." "For this reason we are sorry that the
            course is now a part of the university's curriculum. Our own opinion is that a wiser
            course of action would have been to forego the homophile studies offering at this time."
            Dobler deplored the fact that his view was a "sacrifice to practicality' and a
            "compromise of one's principles."</p>
         <lb/>
         <pb facs="1992.History.8.jpg"/>
         <lb/>
         <q>[The] course was an attempt to promote understanding of the subject of homosexuality on
            the part of advanced students whose careers can be expected to bring them in touch with
            this human problem. There are in our country millions of homosexuals, constituting a
            problem group equal, perhaps, or possibly exceeding the impoverished or various minority
            groups. The remarkable thing is that we do not want to better understand it so we might
            better deal with it. . . . There is no matter or issue in the world that we can
            effectively meet without all the knowledge and understanding of which we are capable. .
            . . Establishment of the homophile course was an enlightened action but an impractical
            one, a contradiction that has to stand as a discredit to the state."</q>
         <p>An editorial in the Lincoln Journal three days later sounded a more urgent note:</p>
         <q>Ramifications of the University of Nebraska's controversial course on homosexuality go
            far beyond the merits or demerits of the course itself. They bear on the very structure
            and integrity of higher education in Nebraska. In his assault on the course Sen. Terry
            Carpenter vows to seek legislation (1) stopping the course and (2) repealing the law
            which gives tenure to faculty members at state institutions of higher learning. If the
            legislature were to go along with this dual attack, it would be preempting authority
            over both curriculum and personnel. The consequences are obvious--and horrendous. . . .
            This would make the University the political football of the Legislature. It would
            destroy the University in short order. It is, in short, an eventuality to be avoided at
            all costs.</q>
         <p>By a parliamentary maneuver, Carpenter's bill was called up for a vote in the spring of
            1971 by members of the legislature opposed to it. It was defeated. The proposal to
            abolish tenure was never introduced.</p>
         <p>The homophile course was not repeated. I felt I could not ask faculty to face more
            harassment. Moreover, it so happened that in 1970 the university had no course in human
            sexuality in the general sense. This seemed anomalous, and Professor Cole decided that
            he was now interested in giving one. For more than a decade, until my retirement, I
            participated in this new course, presenting the material on homosexuality. I also gave a
                  <objectName><ref target="#LitCourse">course</ref></objectName> on homosexuality in
            literature in the English department from 1973 until 1988.</p>
         <p>In retrospect the course seems to me to have been a worthwhile idea that happened to
            come at a politically inauspicious moment. In the event both Greenberg and another
            incumbent regent were defeated in the election. But so were all the incumbents of the
            State Board of Education, which had nothing do do<!-- error? --> with the course, since
            it controlled only the three state colleges and not the university. The public was in an
            anti-student mood because of nationwide campus anti-war disturbances, and voted against
            incumbents, conservative and liberal alike. If the course had been introduced two or
            three years later, it might not have been seriously challenged. As it turned out, the
            experiment had the mixed result of persuading a few academics (most notably Professor
            Cole) to take a serious professional interest in the subject, while scaring others off.
            In my own case, I determined that for the <lb/><pb facs="1992.History.9.jpg"/><lb/> rest
            of my academic career I would do no new research or writing that did not deal with the
            historical, literary, or social aspects of homosexuality. May 5, 1992</p>
