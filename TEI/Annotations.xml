            <p><hi rend="italics">Louis Crompton: The Selected Homofiles</hi> presents a series of
               Louis Crompton's papers, which frame the events that occured at the University of
               Nebraska-Lincoln in 1970 surrounding his organization of the course "Proseminar in
               Homophile Studies," one of the earliest courses on queer sexuality taught in the
               United States. Furthermore, the political fallout which occurred after Crompton
               developed the course bears striking similarities to 21st century politicians'
               attempts to control academic curricula. </p>

         <note type="person" xml:id="terryCarpenter"><label>Carpenter, Terry McGovern
               (1900&#8211;1978) ("Terrible Terry"). State senator, Nebraska Legislature,
               1953&#8211;1955, 1957&#8211;1961, 1963&#8211;1974.</label>
            <p> Born in Cedar Rapids, IA, Carpenter moved to Scottsbluff, NE, in 1916 where he
               worked for various railroad and coal businesses. In 1932, voters of Nebraska's 5th
               Congressional District elected him as a Democrat to the US House of Representatives.
               He served only one term, frequently praising Adolf Hitler on the Congressional
               Record. After unsuccessful campaigns for both the US Senate and the Governor of
               Nebraska, Carpenter started various business interests in Scottsbluff, including a
               gasoline refinery. In 1952, he successfully won election to the Nebraska Legislature
               and served intermittently until 1974 as both a Democrat and a Republican, though the
               Nebraska Legislature is officially nonpartisan. In 1978, after Carpenter died, the
               Nebraska Legislature passed Legislative Bill 955, which renamed the Nebraska
               Educational Telecommunications Building the Terry M. Carpenter Educational
               Telecommunications Building. </p></note>

            <p> Born in Omaha, NE, McBride received a BA from Creighton University in Omaha, NE, in
               1948 and an MA from Northwestern University in Evanston, IL, in 1949. In 1953, the
               University of Nebraska hired McBride as director of television and general manager of
               KUON-TV, Nebraska's nascent public broadcasting network. He served in this role until
               1996, overseeing the development of Nebraska Educational Television in 1963. McBride
               influenced the architectural design of the Nebraska Educational Telecommunications
               Building, funding for which state Senator Terry Carpenter secured through Legislative
               Bill 65 in 1969. In 1971, during the building's construction on the east campus of
               the University of Nebraska&#8211;Lincoln, Carpenter threatened to repurpose the
               building for use by the university's College of Law through Legislative Resolution
               55; however, his motion failed 6&#8211;28 on April 30, 1971. The building
               subsequently opened in 1972, and in 1978, the Nebraska Legislature passed Legislative
               Bill 955, which renamed it the Terry M. Carpenter Educational Telecommunications
               Building. In 2011, the Nebraska Legislature passed Legislative Bill 122, which once
               again renamed it the Terry M. Carpenter and Jack G. McBride Educational
               Telecommunications Building. </p></note>

               Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas in College Station, TX, in 1940 and an
               MA in agricultural economics from the University of Chicago in 1949. Throughout the
               1940s and the 1950s, he served in various professorial and administrative roles at
               Michigan State University in East Lansing, MI, and in 1959, he became the inaugural
               chancellor of Michigan State University&#8211;Oakland in Rochester Hills, MI. In

               University of Nebraska&#8211;Lincoln, the flagship institution; the University of
               Nebraska Medical Center, the former University of Nebraska College of Medicine; and
               the University of Nebraska at Omaha, the former University of Omaha. At the time the
               leader of the university system was known as chancellor and the administrative
               leaders of each institution were known as presidents. In 1970, Varner became the
               second chancellor of the system, a title which was altered to president the following
               year. He thereafter served as president of the University of Nebraska until 1976 at
               which point in time he became president of the University of Nebraska Foundation.
