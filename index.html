  <p>Louis Crompton: The Selected Homofiles presents a series of
               Louis Crompton's papers, which frame the events that occured at the University of
               Nebraska-Lincoln in 1970 surrounding his organization of the course "Proseminar in
               Homophile Studies," one of the earliest courses on queer sexuality taught in the
               United States. Furthermore, the political fallout which occurred after Crompton
               developed the course bears striking similarities to 21st century politicians'
               attempts to control academic curricula.</p>
