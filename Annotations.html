         <p class="editorial"> Born in Cedar Rapids, IA, Carpenter moved to Scottsbluff, NE, in 1916 where he
            worked for various railroad and coal businesses. In 1932, voters of Nebraska's 5th
            Congressional District elected him as a Democrat to the US House of Representatives.
            He served only one term, frequently praising Adolf Hitler on the Congressional
            Record. After unsuccessful campaigns for both the US Senate and the Governor of
            Nebraska, Carpenter started various business interests in Scottsbluff, including a
            gasoline refinery. In 1952, he successfully won election to the Nebraska Legislature
            and served intermittently until 1974 as both a Democrat and a Republican, though the
            Nebraska Legislature is officially nonpartisan. In 1978, after Carpenter died, the
            Nebraska Legislature passed Legislative Bill 955, which renamed the Nebraska
            Educational Telecommunications Building the Terry M. Carpenter Educational
            Telecommunications Building. </p>

            influenced the architectural design of the Nebraska Educational Telecommunications
            Building, funding for which state Senator Terry Carpenter secured through Legislative
            Bill 65 in 1969. In 1971, during the building's construction on the east campus of
