         <p.editorial>In October 1970, Joseph Dean Creason and David Patrick McIntosh co-founded the
            Lincoln Gay Action Group, which held meetings and public forums at the United
            Ministries in Higher Education at 333 North 14th Street in Lincoln, NE. LINGAG's
            original mission was "to study the problems of human sexuality as they relate to both
            women and men and to provide information about these problems to the people of
            Lincoln." The University of Nebraska officially recognized the organization by fall
            of 1971, at which time it took on the acronym UNGAG. </p>

         <p.editorial>On December 15, 1950, the Subcommittee on Investigations of the US Senate Committee
            on Expenditures in the Executive Departments printed "Employment of Homosexuals And
            Other Sex Perverts in Government," which concluded that "those who engage in acts
            of
            homosexuality and other perverted-sex activities are unsuitable for employment in
            the
            Federal Government." The Senate authorized the investigation with the passage of
            Senate Resolution 280 (June 7, 1950), which was influenced by earlier investigations
            conducted by US Senator Kenneth S. Wherry of Nebraska. </p>

            identified people with criminal records of "sexual perversion" as threats to national
            security and barred or terminated them from federal employment. In the 1950s, between
            7,000 and 10,000 workers lost jobs due to suspicions of homosexuality. President
            Barack Obama revoked the entirety of the Eisenhower order through his Executive Order
            13488, which he signed on January 17, 2017. </p>

            City police officers raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village. At
            the
            time, New York State law prohibited public displays of homosexual behavior including
            holding hands, kissing, or dancing with someone of the same sex. The raid sparked
            outrage and led to six days of protests between officers and bar patrons. Stonewall
