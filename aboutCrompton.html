  <p class introduction> Crompton, Dr. Louis (1925&#8211;2009) ("Lou"). Professor, English department, University of Nebraska&#8211;Lincoln.</p>
 <p class="introduction">Born in Port Colborne, ON, Canada, Crompton received both a BA and an MA in 
   mathematics from the University of Toronto in 1947 and 1948 respectively 
   and a PhD in English from the University of Chicago in 1954. He joined the English department at the University of Nebraska in 1955 and 
   specialized in 19th-century British literature and gay history. His magnum opus <em>Homosexuality and Civilization</em> (2003), 
   a 600-page book on the world history of homosexuality, won him the Bonnie Zimmerman and Vern L. Bullough prize of the Foundation for the 
   Scientific Study of Sexuality. In the preface to <em>Homosexuality and Civilization</em>, Crompton wrote:</p>
   <blockquote>The idea for this book was spurred by the fate of a pioneering course on homosexuality I helped organize as long ago as 1970. 
     The undertaking served as a reminder that homosexuality was indeed the <em>peccatum mutum&#8211;the silent sin&#8211;for it 
     prompted a legislator to draft a law banning such academic efforts. The legislative bill, which would have forbidden discussion 
     of the subject at state institutions other than the state medical school, failed to pass, but the course was not repeated. 
     Though it had focused on civil disabilities and then-popular psychiatric theories, the opposition it aroused 
     convinced me that historical research was needed to understand the strength of the taboo homosexuality had inspired.</blockquote>
     <p class="introduction">After the course "Proseminar in Homophile Studies" concluded during the fall of 1970, 
       Crompton went on to become the faculty advisor of the University of Nebraska Gay Action Group (UNGAG). 
       He also founded the the University of Nebraska&#8211;Lincoln Homophobia Awareness Committee. In 2003, 
       the University of Nebraska&#8211;Lincoln recognized his contributions and granted him the Chancellor's Award for 
       Outstanding Contributions to the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Community.</p>
      <p class="introduction">Since 2009, the University of Nebraska&#8211;Lincoln yearly awards the 
        <a href=”https://lgbtqa.unl.edu/cromptondiaz-perdomo-scholarship”>Crompton/Diaz-Perdomo Scholarship</a>, 
        named for Crompton and his husband of forty years, Luis Diaz-Perdomo 
        (1939&#8211;2019), a former faculty member at the university's Counseling and Psychological Services.</p>
